-on button click, also roll all the dices for each item





iterating and creating unique ids for each inputfield div
1. make a counter variable for loop e.g. id = 1
2. make array for all the names values
3. Make object with all the names and put into array


Overarching goals
1. [DONE] Make basic interface 
2. [DONE] Roll dice for all inputted names in array 
3. [DONE] Add in initiative bonuses
  - Add another inputfield for adding initiative bonus
  - Put both name & initiative bonus into object
    -> Make dice roll something within this new object
  - Fix dice roll
4. [DONE] Push object into array
5. [DONE] Assign the turn order
6. [DONE] Output names, dice roll and turn order into UI


Future:
1. Add in logic to determine if monster/player and who goes first if they have same roll number
